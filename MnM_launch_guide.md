# Mocha & Mogra — Full Launch Guide

---

## ✅ What Was Just Done
- **Riwaayat video** — `coverreel3.webm` added as the first media item
- **Splash screen scroll bug fixed** — body is now `position:fixed` while splash is active, so the home page never drifts underneath; it snaps to top on dismiss
- **Apple/Mobile optimisations** — `viewport-fit=cover`, safe-area insets, momentum scrolling, 44px minimum tap targets, double-tap zoom prevention, high-DPI rendering

## 🛒 Shopify Integration — Step by Step

### Step 1 — Create Your Shopify Store
1. Go to **shopify.com** → Start free trial
2. Choose plan: **Basic ($29/month)** is enough to start
3. Set store name: `mochamogra` → Your store URL will be `mochamogra.myshopify.com`
4. Complete store setup (currency: INR + USD if international)

### Step 2 — Add Products in Shopify
1. In Shopify Admin → **Products → Add product**
2. For each saree:
   - Title = product name (e.g., "Sapphire Mogra")
   - Description = the story text
   - Price = ₹9,500
   - Upload all images + videos (Shopify supports video)
   - Add tags like `saree`, `silk`, personality traits
3. Set **inventory quantity** for each product

### Step 3 — Get Your API Credentials
1. Shopify Admin → **Settings → Apps and sales channels → Develop apps**
2. Click **Create an app** → Name it "MnM Website"
3. Go to **API credentials** → Configure **Storefront API** access
4. Enable scopes:
   - `unauthenticated_read_product_listings`
   - `unauthenticated_write_checkouts`
   - `unauthenticated_read_checkouts`
5. Copy your **Storefront Access Token**

### Step 4 — Add to Your Website
Create a `.env` file in your project root (never commit this!):
```
VITE_SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN=mochamogra.myshopify.com
VITE_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` immediately. **Never push API keys to GitHub.**

### Step 5 — Connect Custom Domain
1. Buy domain from GoDaddy/Namecheap: `mochamogra.com` (~₹800/year)
2. Shopify Admin → **Settings → Domains → Connect existing domain**
3. Update DNS records at your registrar:
   - `A record` → Shopify's IP
   - `CNAME www` → `shops.myshopify.com`
4. Your website (hosted on Netlify/Vercel) and Shopify checkout can share the same domain

### Step 6 — Payment Setup (India)
1. Shopify Admin → **Settings → Payments**
2. Enable **Shopify Payments** (if available in India — currently limited)
3. **Better option for India**: Use **Razorpay** or **CCAvenue**
   - Install Razorpay app from Shopify App Store
   - Accepts UPI, cards, net banking, EMI
   - Settlement in 1–3 business days to your bank account

### Step 7 — Shipping Setup
1. Shopify Admin → **Settings → Shipping and delivery**
2. Set up:
   - **Domestic** (India): ₹0 free shipping above ₹5,000, else ₹150
   - **International** (USA, UK, etc.): Flat rate or carrier-calculated
3. Integrate with **Shiprocket** or **Delhivery** for auto label generation
